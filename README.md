Project Name: Alpha Pattern Library

Project Goal:

This project aims to develop a reusable C library that facilitates the printing of various alphabet patterns to the console. The library provides a user-friendly interface for generating these patterns with customization options.

Features:

Core Functionality: Print a variety of alphabet patterns to the console using standard output.
Pattern Types: The library will support a selection of common alphabet patterns (e.g., diamond, hollow rectangle, full rectangle).
Customization: Allow users to specify the desired pattern type and the size of the pattern (number of rows/columns).
Modular Design: Implement the library functions in a modular way to promote reusability and maintainability.
Target Audience:

This library is beneficial for C programmers who want to easily incorporate alphabet patterns into their applications without having to write the pattern generation logic themselves.

Benefits:

Reduced Code Duplication: Saves time and effort by eliminating the need to write pattern printing code from scratch.
Improved Code Readability: Separates pattern printing logic from the main application code, enhancing code clarity.
Enhanced Maintainability: Makes it easier to modify or add new pattern types in the future.
Flexibility: Offers customization options for pattern type and size, allowing for adaptation to different use cases.
Project Deliverables:

C source code files: Contain the implementation of the library functions.
Header file: Declares the function prototypes and any necessary constants/macros for the library.
Optional Documentation: A guide explaining the usage of the library functions, including examples and error handling practices.
Next Steps:

Define Pattern Types: Determine the specific alphabet patterns to be supported by the library.
Design Functions: Plan the functions for handling pattern generation, customization options, and error checking.
Coding and Testing: Implement the library functions and thoroughly test them with various inputs.
Documentation (Optional): Create documentation for the library, explaining its usage and functionalities.
